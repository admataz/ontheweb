On the Web
==========

This is a series of modules to facilitate the inclusion of external content streams on your website. The idea being that
you can compile collections of posts from social media, news sites, blogs, or anything out there with a URL and publish 
them together as a collection, linking off to the original items.

The app is broadly split into two parts: 

 - Server: a RESTful API for collecting items from the web and collating them into collections
 - Client apps: A bookmarklet for collecting items via the browser and an admin app for managing content already 
 collected and collecting items via Social Media APIs

 NOTE: the point here is not to re-publish others' work - it is to compile collections of items relevant to the topics
 of your own site - to provide an overview of how your topic is being discussed online.
