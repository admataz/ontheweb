      "title": "Facebook post by Miriam September",
      "content": "Dear Elders (24 Nov 2011)\n\nBefore we start, we would like to express our gratitude to your important work and we humbly address you, our global elders, some of you the heroes of our youth, to help us, who feel helpless in our suffering.\nIn our tradition, we too have the village elders, which we call \"shimagele\", they are highly respected in our culture and their influence and wisdom is able to tackle relationship troubles, village disputes or murder.\nBut we find ourselves in a situation that has crippled our people, the young and the old, the farmers and intellectuals, those who have remained in the country as much as those who live abroad.\nWe are today writing to you with a plea to hear the cry of a people, a people who were once beautiful, proud, hard working, honest, kind, and full of hope, and who are now oppressed, tortured, trafficked, imprisoned, enslaved, killed. A broken people. A crying country - called Eritrea.\nEritrea is listed among the first three countries for human right violations alongside North Corea, it comes last on RFS's list of press freedom (175th out of 175), it is referred to as Africa's worst dictatorship and the biggest open prison.\nAlmost the entire nation has been enslaved, the majority of youth is either in indefinite military service or in indefinite \"social\" service, they work hard, unable to start a family or to fulfil their dreams and aspirations, they are paid by the government about US$35 a month. Our university has been closed several years ago (probably due to fear of an uprising from there), the last year of high school now takes place at the military school, if you fail the exams you continue in the military if you pass, the government decides what you study. There are reportedly more prisons than schools in our country and if you are still free, rules will imprison you:\n- If your child crosses the border to flee, parents are often made accountable and are asked to pay a high sum of money, if they cannot pay they are imprisoned regardless of their old age.\n- There is no private sector except for a few small shops, hotels, and tea houses, and if you want to renew your license and you have children abroad, you can only renew after your children have made payments to the Embassy in their respective host country.\n- Farmers are not allowed to store their harvest, everything gets confiscated and then small portions are distributed equally to each farmer, the rest is probably sold by the government to other entities.\n- All private medical surgeries have been closed, it was claimed doctors were making money out of their patients, now the few hospitals are completely overcrowded and one has to pay more just to be seen than it cost to see a private doctor.\nPeople hardly survive, in fact if it was not for their relatives living abroad most of them would be ending in extreme poverty.\nBut the worst is yet to be mentioned:\nIn 2001 many of our cabinet ministers, who were former freedom fighters and who had brought independence alongside the leaders of today's dictatorial regimes, are slowly dying a cruel death in desert prisons. Imprisoned with them journalists of our former private press. Among our government ministers two women, both mothers to small children at the time. We know now (from a former prison guard who managed to flee)that they have stayed in hand cuffs for all these years even during the night, locked up in solitary confinement for 10 years not even allowed to speak to the prison guards, no bed, no medical attention, no adequate nutrition. We know now also, that sadly about half of them, around 20 (all named), have died a horrible, slow death. The remaining are set to be mentally impaired, blinded, or unable to walk.\nThey fought for freedom, independence, and justice and yet they were tortured to death by their own comrades, simply for calling openly for democratic reforms and overdue elections.\nBut there are tens of thousands more that have landed in prison, underground or in construction containers in the desert. No one knows where they are or what their crime was.\nThe head of our Orthodox Church, Abune Antonios, who can only be replaced following his death or unlawful action (to be decided by the church council) was taken off his post and put under house arrest, he is not allowed to see any visitors and is said to be in bad health. His crime: He preached about freedom and love and asked the government not to interfere in church matters.\nThe list goes on and on...\nAnother tragedy: Hundred of Eritreans are now being kidnapped and horribly tortured by human traffickers in the Eastern Sudan and moreover, in the Sinai desert of Egypt. Just a few days ago, Channel 25 reporters showed the discovery of a fresh mass grave in the Sinai desert, the majority of those killed were Eritreans, as the kidnappers actively target them. The kidnappers brutally torture the mostly young Eritreans, by burning them with hot iron, cutting off body parts or threatening them to cut them open alive to take out their organs, they do so during live phone calls to relatives in the US and Europe, to make them pay the ransom. Those who cannot paid are killed or used as sex slaves, Israel's hospitals have recorded a sharp increase in abortions from refugees, gain most of them Eritrean, coming through Egypt's Sinai desert. And here it comes: the ransom payment from the relatives in the West is made in most cases to ERITREAN agents inside Eritrea or in the USA/Europe, and it is clear that these agents are government agents who yet again found a way to raise foreign currency income.\nIn the meanwhile, the Western governments have signed a resolution at the UN Security Council for sanctions against Eritrea's leadership over its support to Al-Shabaab. But while the sanctions have been passed, they are yet to be enforced properly: Eritrea's leader are still travelling freely all over the US and Europe spreading their propaganda among their supporters and continue to increase the suffering of those in their hands. Moreover, Western Governments stand by and watch, as the Eritrean Embassies in their countries organise festivals, concerts, conferences, collecting money and taxes, and making a huge profit, although exactly those activities were named in the UN Security's monitor group report as a main source of income for Eritrea's dictatorship and the support to Al-Shabaab. We fail to see the consequence.\nThere is no family in Eritrea that is not affected, no heart that is not full of sadness and despair (except for a few supporters who continue their intimidation campaigns abroad). We have fought hard during our 30 years of independence (1961-1991) and have won independence against all odds, but now our enemy is who were once our brothers and heroes, and it took us years to admit it and to come to terms with that. Now we are slowly rising, our community is waking up in all corners of this world, making noise, campaigning, fighting for real freedom, peace and justice in our beautiful country. But we are running out of time to save thousands and tens of thousands of lives.\n\nWe therefore humbly ask you to support our journey to freedom and justice by any ways you may be able to or feel to be appropriate. Or, if we are allowed to suggest, by\n\n1) Asking Western governments to stop the dictator's money making mechanisms and networks to continue in their respective countries.\n\n2) Asking Sudan and Egypt to hunt down the brutal human traffickers (locations are known, even TV crews, including Al Jazeera filmed the enslaved), Israel to support the victims, and the UN and Western governments to increase pressure on Egypt and Sudan to stop this inhumane cruelty, further because ransom payments are made by US/European citizens.\n\n(added in a follow up e-mail 3. We would like to add urgently among our suggestions for the Elders to use all their power to call upon the Eritrean government to release all prisoners of conscience and religious presecution, in particular the famous G15 (government cabinet) and journalists.)\n\nWe thank you for your kind consideration and know that you have to choose your cases carefully, as you cannot take up all injustice in this world. If you are able to help our people the timing would be very good, as finally our people are standing up against injustice in our country, but we need some support.\nPlease, if you can, listen to the cry of a people who like many of you have fought for their freedom since 1961 and when they finally got independence they found themselves in a new and more brutal set of chains.\nWe thank you.\nSincerely,\nA group of concerned Eritreans",

Sustainability is a start in that direction, but how on earth will the economists deal with that?  Someone who is much more intelligent about these things can hopefully map out a plan for that and show how it will make a better world and for better economic sense for the majority of people. ",

      "content": "It may sound trivial, but if we want to initiate change - perhaps we can learn lessons from those who are driving change in other contexts. Take the campaign by Nike and their 'Kobe System' - they enlisted the help of high profile influential personalities. With such celebrities such as Richard Branson, Tony Robbins etc - who all feel strongly about climate change too - Nike are marketing change. The more people become aware of the reality, and of the consequences of delaying change in terms of sustainable development, the more they are likely to initiate change. If the change was marketed as effectively as 'The Kobe System' - there would be much more change happening. Sharkwater [dvd] was a good example, of using media to drive conservation change. The Elders need a good high profile, celebrity endorsed marketing campaign - with high profile media exposure. There are millions of people out there who haven't heard of The Elders and their causes - but if they did, would join with others to be heard, and drive change.",

          "content": "One of the defining features of the Girl effect is the process it employs; Interest free Microloans. One of the defining results of microloan initiatives is the increased parity of genders in regions where women are considered less valuable than men.\n\nUnlike loans from banks, microloans use REAL, physical bank notes in the form of cash, and do not employ usury. In the North American and European banking systems, the money that is loaned does not actually exist anywhere in the system until you sign the loan agreement, thereby bringing the capital  into being. However, once you have signed the loan agreement, you are then required to pay back REAL money with interest on top. This is called 'Fractional Banking', and is the standard for national currencies. \n\nIn the current systems where child marriages exist, females are viewed as commodities to be sold and traded. The short-sighted nature of this system does not take into account the potential of the Human housed in the female body, thus any potential personal, or economic benefits are lost due to petty descrimination.\n\nAs every endeavor has its process, it my fervent hope that initiatives like this will bring about desperately needed changes in the attitudes of those living in regions where child marriage, and lack of gender parity, are considered facts of life.",
